### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a client who had developed an Android game called Draw It Or Lose It. They wanted to expand their game to more platforms, so they requested consulation for a web-based application to be used in modern web browsers.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did well in the recommendation section of the document, especially with covering the features of AWS that the client may use to enable their web-based service.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Setting up a project with an explicit understanding of the customer's desires and limitations was very helpful in figuring out what information needed to be provided to the client, and how the code should be set up to serve their user schema.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Evaluation section of my document to help make it clear what other options the client might have.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs based on their direct communication, and used those needs to design the software. The client's needs are of upmost importance. They're why the product is being made, and incorporating their needs in the product will mean faster development (through lack of rework) and repeat business.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In the future, I will be able to apply my knowledge of design patterns to make it easier to implement the skeleton of projects. There's no sense in reinventing the wheel with every project, and it will be helpful to use an established pattern to construct projects in the future.
